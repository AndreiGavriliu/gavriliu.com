## Why?

I started this blog because I figured it’s time to share my knowledge and opinions with the world. After all, if it’s on the internet, it must be true… right? Well, apparently not. There’s a ton of outdated info and some outright nonsense out there. Even ChatGPT has its off days — sometimes the info is ancient, and other times it just hits me with the classic 'You’re right!' like I’m talking to a cheerleader instead of getting actual answers. So here I am, doing my part to make the internet a little less… well, internet-y!

## What?

Here are some of the tools I rely on to keep my homelab running smoothly - no particular order, just pure utility. Each one helps me troubleshoot, automate, or manage my setup with less hassle. Because let’s be honest, a well-managed homelab means fewer late-night debugging sessions!
