## Who?

Andrei Gavriliu - Senior IT Consultant | OpenShift @ [ConSol Consulting & Solutions Software GmbH](https://consol.de)

I’ve been working at [ConSol Consulting & Solutions Software GmbH](https://consol.de) since 2012, solving technical challenges and breaking things just enough to learn how to fix them again. I have a passion for technology, whether it’s bleeding-edge Kubernetes clusters or almost century-old bicycles that somehow still work better than modern ones.

When I’m not in front of a terminal, I attempt downhill riding — with a strong emphasis on attempt — while trying to avoid turning myself into a cautionary tale. Homelabbing, rediscovering old tech, and tinkering with anything that has gears, or a slightly questionable user manual keep me busy.

If it’s complex, obscure, or slightly dangerous, I’m probably interested.

I can’t think of any reason why, but if you want to get in touch with me or follow me, here I am:

## Why?

I started this blog because I figured it’s time to share my knowledge and opinions with the world. After all, if it’s on the internet, it must be true… right? Well, apparently not. There’s a ton of outdated info and some outright nonsense out there. Even ChatGPT has its off days — sometimes the info is ancient, and other times it just hits me with the classic 'You’re right!' like I’m talking to a cheerleader instead of getting actual answers. So here I am, doing my part to make the internet a little less… well, internet-y!

## What?

Here are some of the tools I rely on to keep my homelab running smoothly - no particular order, just pure utility. Each one helps me troubleshoot, automate, or manage my setup with less hassle. Because let’s be honest, a well-managed homelab means fewer late-night debugging sessions!

## Privacy & Data Usage

This website values your privacy and only uses local cookies to store your preferences (e.g.: light/dark mode). No third-party tracking cookies or external advertising networks are used.

For comments, the site integrates **[giscus](https://giscus.app/)** ([repository](https://github.com/giscus/giscus)), a GitHub-based commenting system. To participate in discussions, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), as all comments are stored as discussions within my repository.

For analytics, we use a self-hosted **[Umami](https://umami.is/)** ([repository](https://github.com/umami-software/umami)) instance to gather insights on website traffic while respecting user privacy. No personal data is collected, and all analytics data remains within our infrastructure.

Both the static site and the analytics service are hosted in my self-managed homelab, ensuring full control over data and performance.
