      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to push my Kubernetes manifests to GitHub because running Git locally on the same k3s cluster as ArgoCD seemed like asking for trouble. I mean, what happens if something goes wrong?

That’s like sending your passwords in a postcard: ‘Hey, here’s all my private stuff for the world to see!’ So, I decided to use Bitnami’s Sealed Secrets.
