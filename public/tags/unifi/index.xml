            &lt;p&gt;Why would anyone write about their homelab? Well, for one, so future me can remember why I set things up the way I did (and why it inevitably broke). But also, because homelabbing is a mix of art, science, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting. By sharing my setup, I hope others can learn from my mistakes, steal my good ideas, and maybe even tell me how to do things better. After all, half the fun of a homelab is comparing notes with fellow tinkerers who also think ‘just one more server’ is a reasonable life choice.&lt;/p&gt;
